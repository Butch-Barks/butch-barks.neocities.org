						<h5> Just a little post, 12/3/2023 </h5>
						<p> I'm not certain WHAT I should be blogging about.
							Trans issues? Queer issues, in general? My personal life?
							I don't know if I'm making "content" or writing a diary! I guess I'll
							go with diary for now. </p>
						<br>
						<p> Today I worked the brunch shift, which is a nightmare and more.
							It's the hardest shift there is, but of course none of us get paid more
							for working it. We get tipped, but those tips are collected and divided
							amongst the staff based on hours. So you can work the slow shifts and get paid
							with the tip money that was earned by the brunch staff, lol. Which means there's
							NO insentive to working on the weekends, so it's always impossible to find someone
							to cover a sunday shift, cause who would want to do twice the amount of normal work
							and get paid the same amount you get paid for just standing around joking with co-workers
							on a thursday when the cafe is empty of customers.
							<strong> wow, guess this is a vent blog already </strong></p>
						<br>
						<p> Let's see, what else can I post about? I recently got my legal name change finished!
							And with that comes a plethera of issues. One of which is replacing my ID. When I got the
							court-order
							I of course went to the DMV to get a new ID, and that actually went pretty smoothe. However,
							a few weeks ago
							I lost my wallet, I can't find it anywhere in my tiny gay studio apartement, so I assume I
							lost it out in the wilds.
							So, I went online to replace my ID. It asked for my SSN and full legal name, which I gave
							it. Then it told me I don't have
							a valid Identification. Which is bullshit, cause I updated by Social Security info months
							ago right after I got my new ID.
							So, tomorrow I have to spend my day off at the DMV, trying to get that situation sorted out!
							<Strong> That being said, if anyone 
          has questions about changing their legal name in Seattle, let me know. I'm unbearbly aquainted with the system at this point.</strong>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p> P.S. Please forgive any spelling errors, I'm dyslexic and my html editor doesn't come with a
							spellchecker, lol. </p>

				<p> This is my first blog post on this website.</p>
				<br>
				<p> I'm planning on making weekly posts to my blog
					and slowly expanding the amount of posts I make as
					I get used to posting in this format, since it's not
					quite as easy as making a tumblr post -- and maybe that's
					a good thing, lol.
